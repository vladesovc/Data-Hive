## Description
   This project is created for students to utilize a note saving system, allowing them to add and delete as they please or see fit. This was made to assist others and myself with our class and any other need for saving important information. If you dont have a pen and paper, or simply prefer typing notes out then this is perfect and solves anyones inability to take notes. Things solved while doing this project, was finally understanding the true / and /api connections. Very beneficial in helping understand express.
